    <div class="q1">What is Linux From Scratch?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="a1">Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized Linux system entirely from source. </div>
    <br>
    <div class="q1">Why would I want an LFS system?</div>
    <br>
    <div class="a1">Many wonder why they should go through the hassle of building a Linux system from scratch when they could just download an existing Linux distribution. However, there are several benefits of building LFS. Consider the following: </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a2">LFS teaches people how a Linux system works internally</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a1"> Building LFS teaches you about all that makes Linux tick, how things work together and depend on each other. And most importantly, how to customize it to your own tastes and needs. </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a2">Building LFS produces a very compact Linux system</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a1">When you install a regular distribution, you often end up installing a lot of programs that you would probably never use. They're just sitting there taking up (precious) disk space. It's not hard to get an LFS system installed under 100 MB. Does that
        still sound like a lot? A few of us have been working on creating a very small embedded LFS system. We installed a system that was just enough to run the Apache web server; total disk space usage was approximately 8 MB. With further stripping,
        that can be brought down to 5 MB or less. Try that with a regular distribution. </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a2">LFS is extremely flexible</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a1">Building LFS could be compared to a finished house. LFS will give you the skeleton of a house, but it's up to you to install plumbing, electrical outlets, kitchen, bath, wallpaper, etc. You have the ability to turn it into whatever type of system
        you need it to be, customized completely for you. </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="a2">LFS offers you added security</div>
